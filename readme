Hg Tasks

The goal of this project is simple - to create a set of easy to use and effective tasks for working with Hg in NAnt. The primary use
case revolves around using hg within a continuous integration or automated build situation. These tasks should both simplify and 
standardize that process and allow for greater flexibility, without having an NAnt script file to act as the task. Personally, I don't
like using the script tag for anything more complex than a few lines, I find it difficult to read. However, I plan to have this project
create an NAnt xml output version of the script as well as the compiled dll for those who prefer it. Using the script file will make it
easier to edit and customize for specific situations.
